There was talk of making it into a planter, but Ivan and his crew was able to bring the fountain back to life. It's now a central feature of my office building, as it had been in the past.",

I'm very particular when it comes to craftsmanship and finish work and Ivan exceeded my expectations. They were quick and left everything clean, level, and flowing well. Don't bother looking elsewhere (I did the research for you), use Ivan for all your fountain needs!",

Most recently, he came to repair a pipe that disconnected so he stands by his work and will make sure the customer is happy. I would highly recommend. We have been very satisfied every time.",

He completely understood the issues and offered improvements to make our life easier. He even gave us an approximate range of the costs.Ivan was knowledgeable, professional and hard working. Within several hours he replaced our pump, added a new auto water fill valve, installed a new light and even added a new base around the fountain to prevent leaves, dirt and rocks to fall in the fountain basin.",

He quickly diagnosed the problem that the existing pump is made to be above ground, and any dampness near the pump would trip the GFI. He quickly replaced the pump with a sealed pump and it is now functioning as it should be. Ivan was responsive, professional, confidence-inspiring, and his prices were reasonable. Thank you Ivan!",

I've had it for 5 years and I have been cleaning it myself but I knew it needed a deep clean and also to be resealed. Ivan is the right guy for your fountain cleaning job. He and his assistant are on time. Do a great job and in a very organized and clean manner. I was very happy with how my fountain turned out and Ivan also installed a plug for the fountain instead of the sealant putty I had been using. Ivan is a busy guy, so you need to be patient in getting a call back, but it's totally worth it. Thanks Ivan!!!",
