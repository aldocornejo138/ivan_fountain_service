      "They were on time and extremely respectful of our property. (Our fountain is in the center of our home with French limestone floors requiring great care.) They proceeded to move the very heavy fountain, installed a new pump, put it back together and leveled it perfectly. Ivan also wanted to give us the proper amount of water for the space to avoid over-splashing. They deserve every 5 star rating they have earned.",

      "Ivan is the absolute best. I totally recommend him. He cleaned my filthy stainless steel fountain beautifully but when we couldn't get the stainless as shiny as I wanted he came back 3 times to make sure I was satisfied. Where do get that kind of customer service?? His fee was very, very reasonable for his service. You won't make a mistake by hiring Ivan!",

      "We had a large water feature that had a leaking issue that the original installer could not repair nor figure out what the problem was. I called Ivan in the morning and explained to him what was occurring and he was able to give me an idea of what could potentially be the issue. He came out THE SAME MORNING and knew exactly what the problem was and replaced a faulty pump immediately. He also was able to help us with the splashing problem, all for a very reasonable price. He was extremely knowledgeable and very professional. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!!",

      "5 Golden Stars. Ivan and Edgar were Amazing. I had just bought my home and the previous owner hadnt run the waterfall in years. We didnt even know if the pump worked, but we knew it had leaks because there were weeds coming out of the fountain. Now thanks to Ivan and Edgar, the waterfall is running great without any leaks! Thank you Ivan and Edgar very Much!!!",

      "I have an old fountain in the courtyard of my office building. The fountain has been a maintenance problem for about 2 years and inoperable for the past fe months. There was talk of making it into a planter, but Ivan and his crew was able to bring the fountain back to life. It's now a central feature of my office building, as it had been in the past.",

      "Ivan and his guys are top notch. They came and installed two fountains at our new home. From start to finish, they handled everything with care and perfection. I'm very particular when it comes to craftsmanship and finish work and Ivan exceeded my expectations. They were quick and left everything clean, level, and flowing well. Don't bother looking elsewhere (I did the research for you), use Ivan for all your fountain needs!",
